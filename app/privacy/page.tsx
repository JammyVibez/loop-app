In Ireland, the age of digital consent is 16 where an online service relies on a child's consent as its legal basis for processing personal data; for a child below 16, that consent must be given or authorised by the holder of parental responsibility. This does not make 16 a universal minimum age for every online service. LOOP must not rely on a child's own consent for a processing purpose where valid parent or guardian authorisation is legally required. Children also have data-protection rights, and age-appropriate privacy and safety protections must be applied."
